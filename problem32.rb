# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
#
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
#
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
#
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

# 1*2=3456789
# ...
# 1*2345678=9
# 12*3=456789
# ...
# 1234567*8=9
# if we go this way for each of our 362880 permutations we will perform 7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 28 tests. that seems ok.
